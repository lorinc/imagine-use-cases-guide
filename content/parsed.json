This is the right approach—not because AI can't discuss these topics, but because:\n- These conversations often need nuance and relationship context\n- Parents may need to ask follow-up questions or discuss solutions\n- Staff need to maintain their connection to families on sensitive matters\n- The human relationship is part of the value, not just the information\n\n**How this works in practice:**\n\nParent asks: \"Is Sam doing better in Science yet?\"\n\nAI response: \"I can see that Sam has had three Science assessments this term. For a detailed discussion about Sam's progress and any support he might need, Ms. Rodriguez (Science teacher) is the best person to speak with. Would you like me to help you schedule a time to talk with her?\"\n\nThe AI recognized this is academic performance (route to teacher) rather than schedule information (can answer directly).\n\n**The key:** During setup, we would work together to define which question types go where. The AI can then become an intelligent routing system for sensitive topics, while handling straightforward information requests directly.",

Identify specific question types: \"What's on the menu today?\" \"When does the bus arrive?\" \"What's due this week?\"\n2. For each question type, define: What data sources? What's the expected answer format? What if the data is missing?\n3. Create test cases: \"If a parent asks about the menu on a weekend, what should the AI say?\" \"If the bus GPS is offline, how should it respond?\"\n4. Build guardrails: \"Never share grade information.\" \"Always route financial questions to the office.\" \"If asking about medication, refer to the nurse.\"\n5. Test thoroughly before launch with real scenarios\n\nThis discovery process helps ensure the AI does what you actually need, not just what's technically possible.\n\nThink of it like training a new staff member - you wouldn't just hand them all the school's files and say \"figure it out.\" You'd explain your processes, show examples, and check their understanding before they start working independently.",

Parent message arrives\n2. Cheap AI analyzes: \"Is this a school-related question?\"\n3. Routes based on analysis:\n   - **YES, legitimate school question** → Route to smart AI\n   - **NO, off-topic** → Template response: \"I can only help with school-related questions\"\n   - **SENSITIVE TOPIC (academic/behavioral)** → Template response: \"Please contact Ms. Rodriguez directly\"\n\n**Real examples:**\n\nMessage: \"What time does the bus arrive at Oak Avenue?\"\n→ Legitimate → Route to smart AI\n\nMessage: \"What's the weather today?\"\n→ Off-topic → Template: \"I can only help with school-related questions.

The system only spends money on legitimate school-related questions.\n\n**Additional benefits:**\n\n1. **Quality control:** Even legitimate questions get better answers because the routing system can direct specific topics to specific response strategies\n2. **Staff protection:** Sensitive topics automatically route to appropriate humans, maintaining the human connection where it matters\n3. **Spam prevention:** Marketing messages, scams, or spam get caught before consuming any resources\n4. **Usage insights:** You can see what types of questions parents ask most, helping you improve communications\n\n**The key insight:** The gatekeeper costs pennies. It protects against misuse, ensures appropriate routing, and only spends real money on questions that create real value.",

You already have this problem today. But AI makes it more visible because:\n- Parents expect instant, accurate answers\n- Errors are immediately noticed rather than hidden in scattered communications\n- Consistency across all interactions means inconsistent data stands out\n\n**The practical approach:** You don't need to fix all data quality issues before implementing AI. You need to fix the specific data that powers the specific use cases you're implementing.\n\n**Example progression:**\n\n**Phase 1:** Implement bus tracking\n- Need: Real-time GPS data (already exists from bus company)\n- Need: Route schedules (static, update once per term)\n- Need: Student home addresses (already in enrollment system)\n- Data quality fix: None needed, just connect existing sources\n\n**Phase 2:** Add cafeteria menu questions\n- Need: Weekly menu (school already produces this)\n- Data quality fix: Instead of posting as PDF on website, also save in a structured format AI can read\n- Creative solution: Use AI to extract text from the PDF you already create—no process change needed\n\n**Phase 3:** Add \"what's due this week\" questions\n- Need: Assignment tracker kept up to date\n- Current problem: Teachers don't consistently log in central system\n- Creative solution: AI monitors teacher emails and websites where they already post homework, suggests entries for teachers to approve with one click\n- Now teachers spend less time than before, data gets better\n\n**The insight:** Sometimes implementing AI reveals smart ways to improve data collection that actually *reduce* staff workload rather than adding to it. The key is addressing one use case at a time, finding the creative solution for that specific data point, then moving to the next.",
